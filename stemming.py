👨‍💻 Stemming Task

Your goal is to:
1️⃣ Read the content of either story1.txt or story2.txt.

2️⃣ Apply regex with re.sub() to remove:
    - HTML tags (e.g. <div>...</div>)
    - URLs
    - Hashtags (#), asterisks (*), excessive punctuation (e.g. !!!, ???)
    - Extra whitespace

3️⃣ Tokenize the cleaned text into words using nltk.word_tokenize.
4️⃣ Remove stopwords using nltk.corpus.stopwords.
5️⃣ Apply stemming using nltk.stem.PorterStemmer to reduce each word to its root form.
6️⃣ Print out the list of stemmed words.

📌 Hints:
- Remember to import the required NLTK modules.
- Think about what patterns to use in your regex for URLs and HTML tags.
- Inspect intermediate results to ensure your cleaning is working!

Write your code below this string.
